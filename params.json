This means that,\r\nif users wanted, they could theoretically create their\r\nown module extensions if they wanted, but this is not\r\nentirely recommended. To avoid collisions, modules should\r\nbe named by their file and extensions named by the file,\r\na `/`, and the extension file name.\r\n\r\n### ... with HTML\r\n\r\nHTML templates can be created preferably using Jinja2\r\nwhile iterating a repeatable format. This creates a\r\nconsistent format for the modules, and the modules\r\nshould be contained on a single piece of paper, inside\r\nof the fieldset they are created on.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n### ... via bug reports:\r\n\r\nBug reports are openly invited, so long as there isn't\r\nalready an issue. **If your issue is closed without\r\nwarning**, it is likely there is already an issue report\r\nand I don't like cluttering up my mailbox with \"Closed\r\ndue to duplicate report.\" If you have any questions\r\nabout submitting bugs, feel free to [drop me an E-Mail](\r\nmailto:vandor2012@gmail.com).\r\n\r\n### ... via feature requests:\r\n\r\nFeature requests are welcome and can be made in an issue\r\nstarting with \"[Feature]\" - unlike bug reports which\r\nshould just openly state the problem.
