### ... via bug reports:

Bug reports are openly invited, so long as there isn't
already an issue. **If your issue is closed without
warning**, it is likely there is already an issue report
and I don't like cluttering up my mailbox with "Closed
due to duplicate report." If you have any questions
about submitting bugs, feel free to [drop me an E-Mail](
mailto:vandor2012@gmail.com).

### ... via feature requests:

Feature requests are welcome and can be made in an issue
starting with "[Feature]" - unlike bug reports which
should just openly state the problem. The feature should
be explained into detail. Below is a list of already
rejected feature requests:

 * Using something other than Angular Material
 * Using something other than Flask
 * Using an entirely different webpage
  * View my alternative development project [here](
  https://github.com/carbonsrv/diamond).

A list of features to be implemented:

 * [X] Modules
 * [ ] ~~Content generation class~~
 * [X] Monitoring of...
  * [X] Memory
  * [X] CPU Usage...
    - [X] currently
    - [ ] ~~over time~~
  * [X] Listening sockets

### ... via pull request:

Pull requests will be welcome to the project after
December 17th, as that is when the final project
is due for the reason behind this project.

I'm lazy and don't feel like making a lot of things
myself, or keeping everything all optimized, so if
anyone feels like implementing something... Feel
freer than an American with a bald eagle.
